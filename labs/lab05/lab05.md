# Lab 05 - Copilot in Fabric consumption

## Introduction
This page contains information on how the Fabric Copilot usage is billed and reported. Copilot usage is measured by the number of tokens processed. Tokens can be thought of as pieces of words. Approximately 1,000 tokens are about 750 words. Prices are calculated per 1,000 tokens, and input and output tokens are consumed at different rates.
