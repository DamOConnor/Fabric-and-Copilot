- External Azure Subscription
  - **NB** Fabric does not currently work in Microsoft Non-prod / fdpo subscriptions
- Microsoft Fabric Capacity
  - see [this repo](https://github.com/DamOConnor/Fabric-IaC) if you do not already have a Fabric Capacity deployed
- budget to spend **~Â£130** for half-day Fabric F64 consumption


> [!TIP] 
> Use Microsoft Edge Profiles to manage external subscriptions.  Switch off Automated Profile Switching for that profile only.
